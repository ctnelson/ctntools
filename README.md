"ctntools" is a repository of Python functions designed for analysis of (Scanning) Transmission Electron Microscopy Data. It is not a python package. Demonstration use cases are available in the /ctntools/Demos/ folder. This repository is still being updated and expanded. 

Many functions are deisgned for GPU operation requiring the numba package.
